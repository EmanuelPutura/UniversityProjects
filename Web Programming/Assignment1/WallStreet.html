                <p>
                    <b>Wall Street</b> is an eight-block-long street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. It runs between Broadway in the west to South Street and the East River in the east. 
                    <br>The term "Wall Street" has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry, New York based financial interests, or the Financial District itself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wall Street is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the <b>New York Stock Exchange</b> and <b>NASDAQ</b>. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, 
                    including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, the New York Futures Exchange (NYFE), and the former American Stock Exchange. To support the exchanges, many brokerage firms had offices "clustered around Wall Street". 
                    The direct economic impacts of Wall Street activities extend beyond New York City.
