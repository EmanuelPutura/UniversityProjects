-- Could NOT find SQLite3 (missing: SQLite3_LIBRARY) (found version "3.35.4")
-- Configuring done
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (add_executable):
  Target "a67_916_Putura_Emanuel_Vasile" links to target "SQLite::SQLite" but
  the target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?
