% A study is conducted to compare heat loss in glass pipes, versus steel
% pipes of the same size. Various liquids at identical starting temperature 
% are run through segments of each type and the heat loss (in C) is 
% measured. These data result (normality of the two populations is assumed):

%       !             Heat loss               !
% Steel ! 4.6 0.7 4.2 1.9 4.8 6.1 4.7 5.5 5.4 !
% Glass ! 2.5 1.3 2.0 1.8 2.7 3.2 3.0 3.5 3.4 !
