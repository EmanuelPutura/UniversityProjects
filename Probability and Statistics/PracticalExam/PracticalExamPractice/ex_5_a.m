% To reach the maximum efficiency in performing an assembling operation
% in a manufacturing plant, new employees are required to take a 1-month training
% corse. A new method was suggested, and the maager wants to compare the new
% method with the standard one, by looking at the lengths of time required for 
% employees to assemble a certain device. They are given below (and assumed
% normally distributed):

%          !       Assembling times        !
% Standard ! 46 37 39 48 47 44 35 31 44 37 !
% New      ! 35 33 31 35 34 30 27 32 31 31 !
